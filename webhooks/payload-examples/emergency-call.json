The flat above has had a leak and it's coming into our kitchen. We had Ross do our bathroom last year.\n\nSarah: Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. Let me get your details to Ross immediately. Can I confirm your name?\n\nCaller: It's Sarah Thompson, we're at 15 Belsize Lane.\n\nSarah: Of course, Mrs Thompson. And your mobile number?\n\nCaller: 07459 111222.\n\nSarah: That's oh-seven-four-five-nine, one-one-one, two-two-two. I've flagged this as urgent. Have you been able to turn off the water supply?\n\nCaller: Yes, the upstairs neighbour has.\n\nSarah: Good. Ross will call you back within 15 minutes. In the meantime, try to catch what you can with towels and containers.\n\nCaller: Thank you so much.\n\nSarah: Thank you for calling Hampstead Renovations. Goodbye.",
